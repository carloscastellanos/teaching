# Mid-Term Mini-Projects: Material & Behavioral Experiments


Due Date: Week 8 (October 13, 2025)

Value: 20% of Final Grade

## Objective
This mid-term mini-project is an opportunity to synthesize the techniques and concepts we've explored so far through a process of open-ended play and material experimentation. The goal is to create a small-scale prototype that investigates a behavior of some kind - whether of a system, a material, an algorithm, an audience, or some combination thereof.

We have been exposed to a wide range of ideas: from Fluxus event scores and the chance operations of John Cage, to the feedback systems of cybernetics, the responsiveness of interactive art, and the new materials and techniques of creative coding, sensors, mirocontrollers and machine learning. This project is your chance to bring one or more of these ideas into conversation with your own artistic interests. Consider this an opportunity to take risks with your art. The primary goal is thoughtful inquiry and creative process, not a polished final product.

## An Experiment in Behavior
Create a **_prototype_** that explores a specific behavior. Your project should be a focused experiment - nothing too large or complicated, but you should try to create something that expands, augments, questions, analyzes, undermines or otherwise complicates some traditional notion or assumption about art, technology or society. You may try asking some kind of "what if" question. Below are a few examples:

- What if a drawing could be generated by the rules of a game? Perhaps requiring more than one person?

- What if a vase could be made so that is crumbles, collapses or decomposes over time (days, weeks)?

- What if I challenge the assumption that a drawing has to be "finished". Can I make a living, evolving drawing?

- What if a machine learning model interpreted my movements not as commands, but as suggestions for a poem?

- What if the pages of a book reacted to sunlight, slowly changing color over time?

- What if a pillow told me bedtime stories when I laid my head down on it?

- What if my chair "spoke" to me when I sat on it?

- What if I used drops of water to create an animation?

- What if I cultivated plants and/or bacteria so that my studio can have that distinct earthy smell you get after a rainfall?

- What if I treat code like a physical material - can I bend it, break it, or make it glitch in an interesting way?

Your focus should be on the process and the behavior that emerges. What does your system do? How does it react, change, or surprise you?

## Technical & Conceptual Requirements
Your prototype must demonstrate engagement with the ideas and themes of the course by thoughtfully incorporating at least one of the following avenues of inquiry:

- :small_blue_diamond: **Computational Processes:** Using software (e.g., p5.js, ML models) to create generative, time-based, or interactive behaviors. _What are the behaviors of code?_

- :small_blue_diamond: **Physical & Material Interactions:** Creating systems where behaviors, interaction or change emerges from physical properties. This includes:

    - **Electronic Interactions:** Using electronics (e.g., Arduino, sensors, motors) to translate physical actions into digital events, or vice versa. This includes using non-digital/non-electronic materials (e.g., paper, wood, glass, leaves, soil) as integral, responsive components of a system. _How can a physical material mediate or be transformed by a computational process?_

    - **Material Interactions:** Utilizing the inherent properties of materials themselves to generate form, movement, or change. This could involve mechanisms, chemical processes, fluid dynamics, tension, gravity, wind, or light. How does the behavior of a material (e.g., ice melting, crystal growth) become the content of the work?

- :small_blue_diamond: **Environmental Processes:** Designing systems that interact with or are affected by their environment. This could include using sensors to respond to light, sound, temperature, or movement in the space, or creating work that incorporates natural processes like growth, decay, or atmospheric change. _How does an artwork exist not as an object, but as a situation or process within an environment?_

- :small_blue_diamond: **Conceptual & Rule-Based Systems:** Using scores, instructions, or algorithms (inspired by Fluxus or Cage) to dictate the form, process, or performance of the piece. The system itself is the material. _What kinds of behaviors or conceptual provocations are possible from simple instructions or sets of rules?_

You are welcome and encouraged to integrate methods and materials from your own existing practice. The goal is to conduct a genuine experiment, using one of these avenues to ask new questions of your work, to see your familiar materials in a new light, and to look at technology with fresh eyes.

Use your experiment to deepen your concept of "behavior". Reflect on the behavior of a material (e.g., how paint drips, how paper curls when wet) or an environment (e.g., how light changes throughout the day). This is just as rich a subject for artistic inquiry as the behavior of an algorithm or a technological system.

## Deliverables
### Live in-class or in-studio demonstration (5-7 minutes):

* Introduce your experiment. What was your "what if" question? What materials and methods did you choose to explore it? Show us the prototype in action. Interesting failures and unexpected outcomes are as valuable as "successful" works.

* Peer Feedback/Discussion (2-3 mins): The class will provide structured feedback (see below)

### Submitted to myCourses:

* Title and Concept: A descriptive title and a concise artist statement (approx. 100 words) framing your experiment.

* Documentation: Include at least two pieces of documentation. This could be:
    * A diagram of your system/process.
    * A short video of the behavior or process.
    * Photos of the setup (especially if physical).
    * A key excerpt from your code or score (if applicable).

* Reflection (~200 words): Briefly discuss your process. What did you discover through this experiment? How did the behavior of your chosen materials (digital or otherwise) align with or defy your expectations? What is one thing you would change or explore next? Write this up in a Word Processing application (MS Word, Google Docs, Apple Pages, etc) and **submit as a PDF**.

>[!NOTE]
> **Suggestions for commenting on fellow studentsâ€™ work**

Supporting your classmates through feedback on their work is an important part of this course. When watching your classmates present their work, there will be time for verbal comments but you should also take written notes on their presentations and on their project/subject matter, etc. Offer suggestions on what they do well, what they could do differently, useful conceptual strategies and anything they could do to make their work better. Presenters themselves should also take notes during or immediately after their presentations. Share notes, code, ideas, etc; both during and outside of class. The atmosphere in the course should be one of creative collaboration and continual sharing of ideas and practical know-how.

During each demonstration, I suggest providing feedback to your peers using this structure:

- **_Describe_** what you observed without judgment. e.g., "I see a projection that changes color every time a car passes outside," or "I see a program that writes a poem one letter at a time.")

- **_Interpret_** the potential meaning or effect. e.g., "I think the use of the light sensor connects the digital piece to the real world in a beautiful way," or "I think the slow reveal of the text creates a sense of anticipation.")

- Pose a **_thoughtful question_** or suggestion about the materials or behavior. e.g., "I wonder how the piece would behave in a different environment?" or "I wonder what would happen if the rules of the algorithm were more strict?" or "I wonder if this could be translated into a physical object?")
