# Cybernetic Conversations: Building a Digital "Colloquy"
**Concept:** We will move beyond a simple feedback loop and create a simplified digital analogue to Gordon Pask's Colloquy of Mobiles. Instead of one camera looking at itself, we will create multiple digital "entities" that use the video signal to perceive each other and engage in a non-verbal, environmental "conversation." The goal is not to create a visual glitch, but to model a simple ecosystem of perception, response, and interaction.

**Inspiration:** Colloquy of Mobiles by Gordon Pask (1968) â€“ An installation where light- and sound-emitting "male" and "female" mobiles interact with each other and the audience in a cybernetic courtship ritual.
