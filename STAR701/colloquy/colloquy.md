# Cybernetic Conversations: Building a Digital "Colloquy"

**Concept:** We will create a simplified digital analogue to Gordon Pask's [*Colloquy of Mobiles*](https://www.colloquyofmobiles.com/).  We will create two digital "entities" that perceive each other and engage in a non-verbal, environmental "conversation." The goal is to model a simple ecosystem of perception, response, and interaction.

**Inspiration:** *Colloquy of Mobiles by Gordon Pask* (1968) â€“ An installation where light and sound-emitting "male" and "female" mobiles interact with each other and the audience in a cybernetic courtship ritual.

**Tools:** p5.js Web Editor, Webcam

Gordon Pask's *Colloquy of Mobiles* wasn't about pretty patterns; it was a model for conversation (in this context, we define conversation as action-grounded construction of shared meanings). It was a society of non-human agents with simple goals: to find energy (light) and interact with others. They had agency. Their interactions produced emergent, unpredictable behavior. Today, we won't build physical mobiles, but we will create their digital reprsenations. We'll build simple software 'organisms' that can sense each other and react.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand core cybernetic concepts: perception, feedback, adaptation and agency.
- Model simple communicative behaviors in code.
- Shift from thinking of artworks as static objects to thinking of them as autonomous systems with behavioral modlaities.
