# Cybernetic Conversations: Building a Digital "Colloquy"

**Concept:** We will create a simplified digital analogue to Gordon Pask's [*Colloquy of Mobiles*](https://www.colloquyofmobiles.com/).  We will create two digital "entities" that perceive each other and engage in a non-verbal, environmental "conversation." The goal is to model a simple ecosystem of perception, response, and interaction.

**Inspiration:** *Colloquy of Mobiles by Gordon Pask* (1968) â€“ An installation where light and sound-emitting "male" and "female" mobiles interact with each other and the audience in a cybernetic courtship ritual.

**Tools:** p5.js Web Editor, Webcam

Gordon Pask's *Colloquy of Mobiles* wasn't about pretty patterns; it was a model for conversation (in this context, we define conversation as action-grounded construction of shared meanings). It was a society of non-human agents with simple goals: to find energy (light) and interact with others. They had agency. Their interactions produced emergent, unpredictable behavior. Today, we won't build physical mobiles, but we will create their digital reprsenations. We'll build simple software 'organisms' that can sense each other and react.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand core cybernetic concepts: perception, feedback, adaptation and agency.
- Model simple communicative behaviors in code.
- Shift from thinking of artworks as static objects to thinking of them as autonomous systems with behavioral modlaities.

## Set-up:
- Go to https://editor.p5js.org/.
- Create a new sketch.
- Allow webcam access

## Step 1: The Basic World
Copy and paste this code into your p5.js editor

```
let entityA, entityB; // Our two cybernetic entities
let lastMoveTime = 0;
let moveInterval = 3000; // Move every 3 seconds

function setup() {
  createCanvas(640, 480);

  // Initialize our two entities with properties.
  entityA = {
    x: random(width),
    y: random(height),
    size: 50,
    color: [255, 0, 0], // Red
    signalStrength: 0
  };

  entityB = {
    x: random(width),
    y: random(height),
    size: 30,
    color: [0, 0, 255], // Blue
    speed: 2,
    perception: 100 // How far it can "see"
  };
}
```

## Step 2: The Perceive-Think-Act Loop
The loop manages the internal state and interaction between entityA and entityB. Copy and paste into your p5.js editor

```
function draw() {
  background(0, 10); // Semi-transparent background for trails

  // --- CALCULATE DISTANCE (The core "perception" metric) ---
  let d = dist(entityA.x, entityA.y, entityB.x, entityB.y);

  // --- ENTITY A (The Beacon) BEHAVIOR ---
  // Its signal strength is based on the proximity of the Seeker
  entityA.signalStrength = map(d, 0, width/2, 255, 50); // Stronger when closer
  fill(entityA.color[0], entityA.color[1], entityA.color[2], entityA.signalStrength);
  noStroke();
  ellipse(entityA.x, entityA.y, entityA.size);

  // --- ENTITY B (The Seeker) BEHAVIOR ---
  // 1. PERCEIVE: Can it "see" the beacon? (Is it within perception range?)
  if (d < entityB.perception) {
    // 2. THINK/ACT: If yes, change color and move towards the beacon
    entityB.color = [255, 255, 0]; // Yellow = excitement
    let angle = atan2(entityA.y - entityB.y, entityA.x - entityB.x);
    entityB.x += cos(angle) * entityB.speed;
    entityB.y += sin(angle) * entityB.speed;
  } else {
    // 3. THINK/ACT: If not, wander randomly
    entityB.color = [0, 0, 255]; // Blue = searching
    entityB.x += random(-entityB.speed, entityB.speed);
    entityB.y += random(-entityB.speed, entityB.speed);
  }

  // Keep entities on screen
  entityB.x = constrain(entityB.x, 0, width);
  entityB.y = constrain(entityB.y, 0, height);

  // Draw the seeker
  fill(entityB.color[0], entityB.color[1], entityB.color[2]);
  ellipse(entityB.x, entityB.y, entityB.size);
}
```

## Step 3: Run the sketch
Run the sketch and observe. Consider altering the entites' proprties (e.g. signalStrength of entity A; speed: or perception: of entity B).
