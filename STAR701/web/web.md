# The Web as a Canvas: An Introduction to HTML & CSS

The goal of this activity is to introduce you to web coding (HTML and CSS) in a way that is accessible, creative, and immediately rewarding.


Tools: A web browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox) and a text editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, or even a simple one like TextEdit or Notepad). We'll use the browser's developer tools for live experimentation.

Approach: We'll start by explaining that every website is made of two fundamental languages: HTML (the structure) and CSS (the style). We'll use the analogy of a house: HTML is the walls and rooms, CSS is the paint and furniture.

There are three parts:
Part 1: HTML - Building the Structure
Part 2: CSS - Styling the Page
Part 3: Experimentation and Play


## PART I: HTML

**__Introduction__**

HTML is: HyperText Markup Language. It's the skeleton of a webpage, a "markup" language that describs a web page's struture and instructs the browser how to display its contets (images, text, etc). Look at this [HTML Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) for more details.

**__Your First Web Page__**

1. Create folder anywhere on your computer. Call it whatever you like.
2. Create a file in your text editor titled `index.html`. Save it in the folder you just created.
3. Now add the following HTML code to this file:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Art Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Art Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph about my art.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

We will use this as our basic structure.

4. Explanation of each part:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Tells the browser this is an HTML5 document.

- `<html>`: The root element.

- `<head>`: Contains meta information (e.g. title, description) links to CSS, javascript files, etc.

- `<title>`: The title of the page (appears in the browser tab).

- `<body>`: The visible part of the page.

5. Now, let's add more content. Here are some common tags:

- Headings: `<h1>` to `<h6>` (e.g. `<h1> This is Heading 1</h1>`)

- Paragraph: `<p>` (e.g. `<p>This is a paragraph</p>`)

- Image: `<img>` (e.g. `<img src="image.jpg" alt="description" />`)

- Anchor/Link: `<a>` (e.g. `<a href="http://example.com">Link Text</a>`)

- Division (a container): `<div>` (e.g. `<div>anything</div>`)

6. Now create a simple page. Make it a portfolio page, showing your work. Include the following

A few headings (for your name, project titles, etc)

A paragraph about each work.

An image for each work (you can grab images form the web to use as place holders for now).

A link to your web site or that of a favorite artist.

Save the file and open it in a browser to see the results.
