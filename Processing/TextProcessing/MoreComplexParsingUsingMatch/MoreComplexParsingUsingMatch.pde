MORE COMPLEX PARSING USING MATCH
Jeff Thompson | 2013 | www.jeffreythompson.org

Read a file and look for all instances of a particular phrase - we also
add some extra functionality where we ensure that we catch the word
regardless of whether it is capitalized (at the beginning of a sentence,
for example) or not.
