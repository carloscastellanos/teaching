# Course Description

## Catalog Description

Students will design and build creative applications, while studying the history of computation in the visual arts, music, and other relevant areas. Technical topics include advanced audiovisual programming techniques, while theoretical topics include foundational discussions on artificial life, generative art, microsound, participatory and process-based art, programming as performance, and computational creativity. Individual and/or group projects will be required.

## Detailed Description

IGME 531 is a practical introduction to programming and computational media within the context of contemporary art and aesthetics. This is a kind of “studio art course in computer programming”. That is, our objective is art and aesthetics, achieved through the medium of student-written software. Intended for students who have had at least one semester of elementary programming (in any language), this course introduces students to concepts, methods, historical context and critical issues in contemporary arts and culture as they pertain to computational and emerging media technologies. Students will develop or deepen the skills and confidence to produce interactive, generative, and other computationally-based artworks. They will also conduct research and discuss their work in relation to current and historical praxes of computational art and engage critically with emerging technologies.

# Course Profile

## Topics

This course covers the practical application of computer programming techniques to the creation of explorative and/or expressive software art and computational design. General topics include generative art, gestural interaction systems, network and data aesthetics and creative strategies. This will include (but likely not limited to):

- Unpredictability and chance operations
- Fractals & L-Systems
- Time and Interactivity
- Computer Vision & Video tracking

## Course Goals & Learning Objectives

Invention and creative experimentation are the overarching goals and ethos of this course. In addition, at the course’s conclusion, students will be able to:

- Demonstrate proficiency in creating computer programs capable of responding to user interaction, in a variety of different creative coding tools
- Demonstrate a basic understanding of aesthetics and its relationship to computation
- Identify and discuss the work of artists, researchers and other creative practitioners working in Generative/Computational Art and related fields
- Understand the role of computation in artworks that explore concepts of transmediality, generativity, connectivity and complexity.
- Identify and discuss historical, theoretical and societal issues associated with computational media and emerging technologies.
- Understand how to document, discuss and present creative work

## Required Texts

There are no required text purchases for this course. Readings and lecture materials will be provided through MyCourses. There is however an optional text listed below and other learning resources (books, web sites, etc) available through myCourses.

## Learning Resources

Available resources include books, videos, web sites and GitHub repositories. We will also make use of threaded online discussions. All of this is available through (you guessed it) myCourses.

## Assessment Structure

There are no required text purchases for this course. Readings will be provided through MyCourses and lecture notes.

# Assignments

## Overview

Assignments are not simply about writing code. Every assignment will have associated readings, research and reflective writing components (discussed below). In addition, your instructor will provide important historical context, show examples and provide other notes and resources relevant to the assignment topic/theme. Tentatively, there are 8 main assignments (software art programming projects):

1. Training Camp (skill-building)
2. Noise, Fractals & Generative Forms
3. Chance, Indeterminacy & Anti-art
4. Networks & Telematics
5. Sonic Creatures
6. AI/Machine Learning
7. Augmented Body
8. Self-Directed Final Project

## Readings + Response

Readings, videos, and other supplementary materials will be prescribed throughout the semester. These might include excerpts from academic texts, academic papers, recorded conference talks, blog posts, or any other material I think is interesting and worth your time. It’s best to think of this as a curated collection of material; you could find it on your own, but I’m saving you the work of sifting through the entire internet for the good bits. It’s important that you take the time to watch and read these. I may ask you to submit some artifact attesting to your having done so. If you’re struggling to keep up with them, don’t hesitate to ask for help. I may recommend which prescribed content is most important, or help you skim through the content to the most important bits.

## Reflections

Weekly reflections are lightweight, freeform opportunities for you to think just a bit further on the class’s topics. They will be required every week, and function as the class’s heartbeat: they let me know you’re still invested, if you’re struggling to keep up, where you are in understanding the material. They are not intended to stress you out or require a great deal of effort, and only require that you take a moment every week to think creatively and critically on what you’ve learned.

# Grading

In general, grading procedure for the course follows [University Policy D05.0](https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/d050), which describes policies regarding points awarded for grade, handling of withdrawals (D05.0, Section IV), and so on.

## **Evaluation Criteria**

I will do my best to provide feedback for all submitted work within two weeks of the submission deadline (per University policy) and will post all grades to MyCourses. However, depending upon circumstance, feedback may be provided more than two weeks after the submission deadline.

In addition to the grade for projects, assignments and exams, I will add any additional notes and feedback to the grade in MyCourses.

If you have any questions about a grade, you are welcome to discuss with me further via email or in-person by scheduling a meeting.

## **Late Policy**

Assignments are due at the announced date and time (usually the due date posted with the assignment drop box on MyCourses). There is no grade deduction for submitting work late, but late submissions will not be accepted once we start grading the assignment in question. _We may begin grading at any point after the due date._

- If you foresee a scheduling conflict with a posted assignment, contact me as soon as possible to work out an alternative submission plan.
- Certain project milestones and/or assignments may not be submitted late at all, if their completion is necessary to participate in class (for instance, if we will be critiquing a project milestone in class the day after it is due, late submission of this milestone will prevent you from participating in class). These will generally be announced.
- If an assignment is going to be critiqued in class, then it must be completed on time for full credit.

_As a final caveat to the above_, I'm not interested in being a hard-ass about this. If things aren't going your way or extenuating circumstances begin to extenuate, talk to me and we can usually work something out.

## **Attendance**

Attendance is not strictly mandatory, but infrequent attendance will significantly impact your grade. There will be in-class activities that cannot generally be made up if you miss class, and these will often happen without previous warning.

It never hurts to let me know your plans ahead of time. If you’ve not typically missed class, I will wonder where you are. Generally, the more information you can give me the better I can help you and assist you in your learning. If you are dealing with a stressful situation and need a bit of slack, talk to me and we can work it out. If you wish to attend interesting events of professional interest, contact me to discuss possibilities for extensions on work deadlines.

In any case, if you miss class or cannot fulfill participation requirements, you are responsible for checking with classmates for notes and MyCourses for posted materials.

If I need to miss class, I will let you know as soon as possible both through email and Discord. The department will also post a sign on the classroom door letting you know.

# **Additional Information**

## **Succeeding in my class**

### Read the readings

All the knowledge in the world is written down, and it takes very little effort to acquire it. The amount of know-how and skill you take away from this class will be directly correlated with the amount of reading you do; use this cheat code to win.

### Take notes

I **strongly** recommend that you take notes, and that you do so on paper. Paper will help you focus and is conveniently free of all the distractions endemic to digital media.

[You will learn more efficiently on paper](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away?fbclid=IwAR3ZcxFz5PeLs9WOdsAw0tpNeD3ZmxkYLn3nJq6YYj3mpR22ksybcTOfG8Y).

### Ask questions

We’re all here to learn, and we’ll all have moments when we don’t know something. Ask me (or your classmates) questions when you don’t know something, and take risks on iffy answers. Everyone will be better off for the conversation.

### Participate recklessly

I find I learn best when learning is an act of play, and an earnest exploration into unknown territory. That requires that you be open to making mistakes, to giving the wrong answer in class, and risking that you’ll look like a fool. The more we can dive in with that philosophy, the better the course will go.

## **Communication**

I will be using Discord primarily, but also email and MyCourses, to communicate reminders, updates to assignments, and so on. Please check Discord and your email regularly to make sure you have the most up to date information. You are welcome to communicate anything to me regarding the course via email or Discord . I will almost always respond to emails within 24 hours, and to Discord messages usually within an hour or two.

**If you need to discuss grades or personal matters, I ask that you do it through my RIT email address**. Legally, since Discord is not FERPA compliant, I cannot discuss those sorts of things there.

## **Notices of Accommodation**

If you have a "Notice of Accommodation", I should have received a copy electronically. Please discuss this with me after class or in person so that we can make sure all of your accommodations are met.

##

## **Academic Dishonesty**

The RIT policy on academic dishonesty is available at: [http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html](http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html). I have a responsibility to the university to ensure that academic dishonesty does not happen by anyone in my courses and I take this responsibility very seriously. I also think upholding academic integrity is simply the right thing to do.

In this course, if you violate the academic dishonesty policy, you will receive an "F" grade for the course, I will file a letter with the department detailing the incident for your records folder, and you will be immediately removed from the class. (If this is a second occurrence during your career at RIT, the penalties are harsher.)

I really hate to see anyone fail a course this way, so if you have any questions about your work and these policies, the easiest thing to do is to double-check with me before submitting your work. That way, I can let you know if there's any issues and we can ensure your work is safe to submit.

# **Final Note**

Any and all of the previous information is subject to change or modification during the semester, but always with notice. Any changes will be announced in class and communicated electronically.
