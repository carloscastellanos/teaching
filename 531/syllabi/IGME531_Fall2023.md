# Course Description

## Catalog Description

Students will design and build creative applications, while studying the history of computation in the visual arts, music, and other relevant areas. Technical topics include advanced audiovisual programming techniques, while theoretical topics include foundational discussions on artificial life, generative art, microsound, participatory and process-based art, programming as performance, and computational creativity. Individual and/or group projects will be required.

## Detailed Description

IGME 531 is a practical introduction to programming and computational media within the context of contemporary art and aesthetics. This is a kind of “studio art course in computer programming”. That is, our objective is art and aesthetics, achieved through the medium of student-written software. Intended for students who have had at least one semester of elementary programming (in any language), this course introduces students to concepts, methods, historical context and critical issues in contemporary arts and culture as they pertain to computational and emerging media technologies. Students will develop or deepen the skills and confidence to produce interactive, generative, and other computationally-based artworks. They will also conduct research and discuss their work in relation to current and historical praxes of computational art and engage critically with emerging technologies.

# Course Overview

## Topics

This course covers the practical application of computer programming techniques to the creation of explorative and/or expressive software art and computational design. General topics include generative art, gestural interaction systems, network and data aesthetics and creative strategies. This will include:

- Unpredictability and chance operations
- Fractals & L-Systems
- Time and Interactivity
- Computer Vision & Video tracking
- AI/Machine Learning
- Artificial Life & Creative Ecosystems
- Digital Fabrication/3D Printing
- Sound synthesis
- Dada & Surrealism
- Fluxus Movement
- Conceptual Art
- Situationism
- Network Art & Telematics
- Systems Art & Cybernetics

## Course Goals & Learning Objectives

Invention and creative experimentation are the overarching goals and ethos of this course. In addition, at the course’s conclusion, students will be able to:

- Demonstrate proficiency in creating computer programs capable of responding to user interaction, in a variety of different creative coding tools
- Demonstrate a basic understanding of aesthetics and its relationship to computation
- Identify and discuss the work of artists, researchers and other creative practitioners working in Generative/Computational Art and related fields
- Understand the role of computation in artworks that explore concepts of transmediality, generativity, connectivity and complexity.
- Identify and discuss historical, theoretical and societal issues associated with computational media and emerging technologies.
- Understand how to document, discuss and present creative work

## Required Texts

There are no required text purchases for this course.. There is however an optional text listed below, along with other learning resources (books, web sites, etc) available through myCourses. You will also be required to open an account at [OpenProcessing.org](http://openprocessing.org)

_Optional Text:_

Levin, G., & Brain, T. (2021). _Code as creative medium: A Handbook for Computational Art and Design_. MIT Press.

## Required Materials

- Computer: Students should have access to a desktop or laptop computer with a webcam. A reliable internet connection will also be very important.
- Sketchbook: It is extremely wise to plan your projects on paper before writing any code. In support of this, you are required to maintain a paper sketchbook for this course. Most assignments will require you to post images of your project sketches.
- Programming Environments: This is a polyglot course; the programming environments used for example projects and sample code will be a mixture of p5.js (JavaScript, optionally with Visual Studio Code and the p5.vscode extension), Processing (Java), Python and possibly openFrameworks (C++) and Max/MSP/Jitter (visual programming environment). Depending on the assignment, you may also use any other media development environment or programming language you are comfortable with (e.g., Unity (C#), Swift, etc.).
- Camera: Students should have access to a digital camera to document certain projects. A smartphone with a camera is acceptable.

## Learning Resources

Available resources include books, videos, web sites and GitHub repositories. We will also make use of threaded online discussions. All of this is available through (you guessed it) myCourses.

## Assessment Structure

Grades will be generated through a [labor-based grading contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_grading#Labor-based_contract_grading), which will be negotiated with the students at the beginning of the semester, and re-evaluated at mid-semester. This contract will be based on factors including completion of assignments and attendance.

There are approximately 8 main assignments (software art programming projects) on which students will receive critical feedback from the instructor and their peers. Critical feedback on the content or quality of projects will not factor into grades, except where such feedback concerns missing components of the assignment.

# Philosophy

This course operates under the following principles:

**Experiential Learning.** We learn by doing. The course emphasizes immediate application of theory into practical demonstrations. Success — and especially failures — of an experiment helps create understanding of underlying principles.

**Collaboration & Cooperative Learning.** We teach each other. Knowledge sharing and creative dialogue are critical to success in this course and in creative work in general. Success in this field requires an ability to collaborate within diverse cohorts of technology, arts and design experts. Collaborative skill requires excellence in one’s own areas of expertise and an ability to translate ideas across disciplinary boundaries.

**Self-motivation.** Students are responsible for their own progress. Wherever possible, the driving motivation will be a self-chosen goal, divided into manageable subproblems. The desire for the goal prompts autonomous exploration. If you ever find the course dull, that is an opportunity to reflect on what you are trying to achieve and choose a new objective.

**Critical Thinking, Reflection and Writing.** Understanding develops through reflection, and the best discipline for reflection is writing and drawing. Mere repetition of the examples does not build skill; it is the process of reflection which integrates experience into knowledge which can be applied to novel situations.

# Attendance

## Attendance & Presence

_"80% of success is showing up"_— Woody Allen

Your presence and earnest participation in the class are of paramount importance. You are responsible for what happens in class whether you are here or not. Organize with your classmates to get class information and material that you have missed.

Additionally, communication is paramount when it comes to your attendance. If you are going to be absent or tardy, please contact the professor in a timely manner regarding your situation. Email is best, but I am also amenable to receiving messages via Twitter DM, or the RIT Slack. If you are ill, or if you know you will have a planned absence, please let me know before the beginning of that class session. I can be very understanding and accommodating about planned and necessary absences, family circumstances, and/or medical issues when you inform me in a timely and professional manner.

Regarding your mental presence in the classroom: physical presence means nothing if you are "checked out". Focus is precious, and your mental presence is extremely important. During the professor's lectures or (especially) during guest presentations, distracted "participation" is simply put — bad form, and will not be tolerated. You can survive for a couple of hours without texting, tweeting, chatting, emailing, or doing work for other courses.

## A Word About Unexcused Absences in Critiques

Sometimes, students who haven’t completed their projects skip class during critiques, because they are too embarrassed to come to class empty-handed. This type of absence is particularly self-destructive, and is one of the most objectionable things you can do in this class. Please have courage. Your participation on critique days is essential, even if your own project is incomplete or missing, because these sessions and conversations help you understand our class standards, expectations, and criteria for good work. **Even if your own project is unfinished, you are still expected to contribute productively to the class discussion**.

## Attendance Policy Summary

**Terms:**


* A **class event** is an in-class activity, such as a lecture or critique, in which your presence and participation is expected.
* An **excused absence** is one in which you've communicated responsibly with the professor prior to class. For example, if you've sent an email to the professor because you're not feeling well, or if you know in advance that you're going to be observing a religious holiday or traveling to a job interview. Contacting the professor beforehand can make it possible to provide you with accommodations—such as recording a class event, or providing a Zoom connection for a remote participant.
* An **unexcused absence** is one in which you've _ghosted_ a class event, without communicating beforehand with the professor.
* A **mental absence** is a form of partial absence in which you might as well be elsewhere. For example, while walking around the room, I plainly observe that you're working on homework for another course. Sleeping in class is also a form of mental absence.
* **Tardiness** is a form of partial absence in which you are more than 20 minutes late to a class event. Tardiness may be excused or unexcused.

**Policies:**


* Students should contact the professor before class to alert him to their absence.
* Our labor-based grading contract (to be negotiated) will assign grades that factor in a count of unexcused absences, but not excused absences.
* You are permitted one unexcused absence.
* A post-hoc excuse for an unexcused absence may or may not be accepted, at the professor's discretion.
* The first incidence of unexcused tardiness will be noted, but excused.
* The first incidence of mental absence will be noted, but excused.

**Advisory:**

The three least forgivable violations of our course attendance policy are:

1. Sleeping during a presentation by an outside guest
2. Unexcused absence during a critique
3. Unexcused absence... and then I bump into you in the hallway chatting with your friends later that day

# Assignments

## Overview

Assignments are not simply about writing code. Every assignment will have associated readings, research and reflective writing components (discussed below). In addition, your instructor will provide important historical context, show examples and provide other notes and resources relevant to the assignment topic/theme. Tentatively, there are 8 main assignments (software art programming projects):

1. Training Camp (skill-building)
2. Representing Time
3. Chance, Indeterminacy & Rule-based Systems
4. Un-Drawing Machine
5. Networks & Telematics
6. Augmented Body
7. AI/Machine Learning
8. Self-Directed Final Project

## Journal & Documentation

Every assignment requires that you document your process. **You will be expected to keep an online journal/blog** of your work in this class. Project updates, research process, readings, interesting links – all of these go in your journal. Specific requirements will be provided for each assignment. Part of these requirements will entail the submission of a ["Field Report"](https://github.com/carloscastellanos/teaching/blob/master/531/syllabi/field-report.md). You will periodically be asked to "survey the field". That is, browse various blogs, web sites, academic journals or other resources in order to deepen your knowledge of the field and familiarize yourself with the current state of the art. You will then be expected to report on your findings — hopefully with a critical perspective. Some weeks, the "Field Report" deliverables may be thematically oriented. There is no restriction on the sources of information you may use.

The journal is a reflection of yourself as a professional and should demonstrate that. Therefore, even if you do have a website/blog already, **this course requires that you create a website/blog unique to this course**. This will be a website that you will continue to use throughout this course and perhaps your duration in the program. Free blogging platforms like WordPress or Weebly will work just fine.

In addition to the journal, you will also upload your programming assignments (with some possible exceptions) to the OpenProcessing web site. This will make it easier for all of us to see your programming assignments. You will simply need to post a link to the Processing or P5.js sketch in your assignment submission.

**Good documentation habits:**

Document your projects thoroughly as you go, do not put it off until the end. Plan in advance to have what you need to document. Photos, video, sketches, schematics, code and notes are all possible forms of documentation. More specific instructions will be given for each assignment but in general you will need to include general description (what it is, does), the goal(s) of the project, add the ideas/inspirations and results/experience (i.e. a narrative reflection). Your explanation should give enough information that someone who’s never seen the project can understand it. In addition (as mentioned below), you will also write a reflection on the readings and your overall research process.

Make sure the code is well-commented, so you and others can understand what it does. You may post your code (and other relevant files) to a code repository site like GitHub (in addition to OpenProcessing).

Make sure to cite sources from which you get your ideas, code, and construction techniques. When you base your work on someone else’s, cite the original author and link to their work, just as you would when quoting another author in a paper. Very few ideas come out of nowhere, and your readers can learn a lot from the sources from which you learned and by which you were inspired. This is how knowledge and innovation work. So please be generous in sharing your sources.

## Readings & Response

Readings, videos, and other supplementary materials will be included as part of every assignment. These might include excerpts from academic texts, academic papers, recorded conference talks, blog posts, or any other relevant material. **You will be expected to write a short 1-page response for each in your journal.** Remember that this is essentially a curated collection of material. You could do your own research (and will, especially for your final project), but I am helping you by sharing what I think is most important. Part of learning is knowing where to look and conducting your own research. This is why it is important to do the readings, and come to class with thoughts and questions for discussion. It helps you gain confidence in these “meta-skills” of researching, questioning, generating ideas, etc. As always, if you’re struggling to keep up with the readings, do not hesitate to ask for help.

# Grading

Your work will be evaluated according to three different schemes, which are decoupled to the greatest extent possible:

- **Grades**: standards used by RIT on its transcripts to indicate your objective level of effort in a course; see Class Grade Components below
- **Rubrics**: standards used by our class community in critiques to provide subjective feedback about your creative projects
- **Professionalism**: standards used by the professor to judge your professional conduct, which help me decide whether I might someday write a letter of recommendation for you, agree to offer independent study credits to you, hire you as a research assistant, etc.

## Rubrics for Creative Projects

The purpose of our open-ended projects is to provide well-circumscribed opportunities for you to make creative work with code. Generally, the prompts will invite you to explore a specific conceptual theme or set of programming techniques. As such - and since there is no “correct” or “best” or “optimal” artwork - there is no correct solution to these assignments and no specific requirement for how to implement your idea (unless otherwise specified). A prompt also asks not just for a creative solution, but also for some **creativity in defining and approaching the problem**. It is expected that your projects will be documented and published to your online journal.

With creative projects, it may not matter how much time a student spent making it. You may sometimes observe a very quickly-executed solution which succeeds because of its strong concept. Usually, however, the quality of a project is rewarded by extra attention to its craft.

In our critiques, we will evaluate your open-ended projects according to the following subjective considerations:

- **Curiosity:** Are you asking questions as you work?
- **Perseverance:** Are you forging through difficult problems without giving up?
- **Execution:** Are you crafting with purpose, precision, and attention?
- **Inventiveness and Risk-Taking:** Are you discovering/exploring methods outside the obvious and predictable? Are you taking risks and pushing past what you already know and discovering new territories, terms, skills, connections, etc. Ideas that fail often teach more than ideas that succeed.

## Grade Calculation

Grades will be calculated via a [labor-based grading contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_grading#Labor-based_contract_grading), which will be negotiated with students at the beginning of the semester, and re-evaluated at mid-semester. This contract will be based on objective factors that include the number of projects you complete, your fulfillment of the project requirements, and your attendance.

In this course, your grades boil down to fulfillment. Projects always have a list of supporting requirements. These are very straightforward to fulfill, but if you fail to meet these, you will have points deducted. Nearly every project assignment will ask you to do the following:

- Create a unique blog post for your project, on our course website.
- Title and Categorize your blog post in a specified manner.
- Embed a photo of your notebook sketches for the project, if applicable.
- Embed a static image of your project, such as a screenshot or photograph.
- Embed dynamic documentation of your project (such as an animated GIF, video recording, or interactive applet) into the blog post, if applicable.
- Read an article(s) or watch a video and write a short (~1-page) response.
- Write 100-200 words about your project, describing its development process. In your writing, include some critical reflection and analysis of your project: In what ways did you succeed, and in what ways could it be better?
- Embed or link to your code, if requested.
- As per our course policies on Academic Integrity, you must also:
  - Name any other students from whom you received advice or help. If you had collaborators, explain how the work was distributed among the collaborators.
  - Cite and link to the sources for any code, external libraries, or other media (e.g. photographs, soundtracks, source images) which you used in your Project. **Citing your sources is very important**. If in doubt, err on the side of generosity.

## Grade Components

Grading procedure for the course follows [University Policy D05.0](https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/d050), which describes policies regarding points awarded for grade, handling of withdrawals (D05.0, Section IV), and so on.

## Professionalism

There are a few elementary things you can do to ensure that you retain my highest respect for your professionalism. These things may seem simple and obvious, but it’s sometimes surprising how few students seem to get this right. At a minimum, I ask you to:

- **Be nice.** Maintain a positive, friendly attitude.
- **Be present.** Show up to all course sessions, on time.
- **Be responsible.** Communicate with the professor beforehand if you must miss a session or if there are any problems, questions, or circumstances that hinder your full participation in the course.
- **Be diligent.** Submit your deliverables, on time, with clear and thorough documentation.

Beyond this, I would love it if you could:

- **Be helpful.** Help your classmates when they’re stuck.
- **Be fearless.** Take risks. Work outside your comfort zone. **Give yourself permission to be weird.**
- **Be conscientious.** Pay attention to details of craft and execution. Put your heart in the work.
- **Be persevering.** Become resourceful about getting the assistance you need.
- **Be generous. ** Participate in the life of the course. Make helpful contributions to lectures, discussions and critiques.

## Late Policy

Assignments are due at the announced date and time (usually the due date posted with the assignment on myCourses). When you submit work late, you will miss an important opportunity to share, show off, discuss and get critical feedback on your work. To receive this important feedback, your work must be available for evaluation during the critical review period. Thus, to receive full credit towards your grade, projects should be uploaded and completed by the time that I get around to checking them and/or by the time we have class discussion and critiques on them (which is usually on the stated due date or a few days after). If not, I reserve the right to assign partial or zero credit to them. If you know you're going to be a little late with a project, contact me to arrange an accommodation.

## Follow Your Passion

I will assume that most of you are here (that is, in this class and/or at IGM) because you are passionate about games, media arts or otherwise combining technology and creativity. With very rare exceptions (I’ll be clear), I will almost always prefer that you **make the assignment interesting to you** — if necessary, by creatively bending the rules or re-interpreting the assignment. My assignments are starting-points, prompts and propositions. Think beyond them.

Notwithstanding the above, you will always be expected to conform to certain supporting requirements (described above) in regard to deliverables and documentation. Did you include an image of your project? Did you write the requested narrative? Such requirements are non-negotiable.

# Academic Integrity

The RIT policy on academic integrity is available at: [http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html](http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html). Please read them to understand the penalties associated with academic dishonesty. I reserve the right to determine an appropriate penalty based on the violation of academic dishonesty that occurs. The penalty for plagiarizing may range from failure on the specific plagiarized assignment to failure in the class. If you have any questions about this policy as it relates to work you are doing in the course, please feel free to contact the professor.

## Policies for Open-Ended Creative Projects

For your open-ended, public-facing projects, which will be presented and hosted online on myCourses, GitHub or OpenProcessing.org, there are no “correct answers”. Your curiosity, creativity, ingenuity and originality are what’s important.

You may borrow code or ideas from other sources, within the limits of “reasonable person” principles described below, provided you **attribute your sources**. Your work will appear, publicly, on the open Internet. Your projects will likely be discussed and critiqued in front of (and with the assistance of) your peers.

You are expected or invited to make extensive use of open-source libraries and tutorials. When working in this way, much like a knitting circle, our classroom is structured around peer instruction, in which students are expected to help each other learn.

## Use of Free and Open-Source Code in Projects

You are expected or invited to make extensive use of open-source libraries and tutorials. When working in this way, much like a knitting circle, our classroom is structured around peer instruction, in which students are expected to help each other learn.

Credit is perhaps the most important form of currency in the economies of commons-based peer production and open-source media arts. You are expected to cite the source of any code you use. Please note the following expectations and guidelines:

**Use Libraries.** In your projects, the use of general, reusable libraries is strongly encouraged. The people who developed and contributed these components to the community worked hard, often for no pay; acknowledge them by citing their name and linking to their repository.

**Be Careful.** It sometimes happens that an artist places the entire source code for their artwork online, as a resource from which others can learn. The assignments professors give in new-media arts courses are often similar; you may discover the work of a student in some other class or school, who has posted code for a project which responds to a similar assignment. You should probably avoid this code. At the very least, you should be very, very careful about approaching such code for possible re-use. If it is necessary to do so, it is best to extract components that solve a specific technical problem, rather than those parts which operate to create a unique creative experience. Your challenge, if and/or when you work with others’ code, is to **make it your own**. It should be clear that forking an artwork from someone’s page on GitHub, OpenProcessing, etc., and simply changing the colors would be disgracefully lazy. Doing so without proper citation would be plagiarism.

## Informal Collaboration

This course places a very high value on civic responsibility that includes, but is not limited to, helping others learn. In this course, we strongly encourage you to give help (or ask others for help) in using various toolkits, algorithms, libraries, or other facilities. Please note the following expectations:

- In this class, **it’s OK to give and receive help.** In fact, it’s better than OK! But students who receive help from someone else are obliged to acknowledge that person in their project report, clarifying the nature of the help that was received.
- **We are all teachers.** Students with advanced skills are expected to help others, yet refrain from doing another’s work for them. You can usually tell when you’re about to cross the line: Ask yourself whether you are teaching someone to fish, or merely giving them the fish.
- When in doubt: **give credit** to the people who have helped you.

## Formal Collaboration

The assignments in this course are primarily intended to be executed by individuals. That said, I am in favor of students collaborating if such collaborations arise organically and can be conducted safely. Please note the following expectations:

- **Notify the Professor.** It’s helpful for me to know who is working with whom. Students who wish to collaborate should jointly inform the professor as early as possible.
- **Only pairs.** Unless permission is explicitly granted by the Professor, collaborations in this course are restricted to pairs of students.
- **Describe who did what.** Written reports for collaborative projects should describe how your effort was distributed.
- **Only IGME531 collaborators.** Your project collaborator, if you have one, must be in this class. You may not collaborate with people from outside the course (e.g. your housemate).
- **Avoid codependency.** You may not collaborate with the same person (i.e. submit an assignment jointly) on more than two projects.

# Additional Information

## Communication

I will be using email and myCourses announcements to communicate reminders, updates to assignments, etc. Please check these regularly to make sure you have the most up to date information. You are welcome to communicate anything to me regarding the course via email. I will almost always respond to emails within 24 hours. We will also use myCourses discussions for questions, link-sharing and general class discussion. I am also available via Twitter.

**If you need to discuss grades or personal matters, I ask that you do it via my RIT email address**.


## Statement on Well-Being & Success

Success in this course depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Recognize that stress is an expected part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the classroom. Moreover, those with marginalized identities may be faced with additional social stressors. Your other instructors and I strongly encourage you to reframe challenges as an unavoidable pathway to success. Reflect on your role in taking care of yourself throughout the term, before the demands of exams and projects reach their peak. Please feel free to reach out to me about any difficulty you may be having that may impact your performance in this course as soon as it occurs and before it becomes unmanageable. In addition to your academic advisor, I strongly encourage you to contact the many other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you.

## Statement on the Use of Generative AI

I will not forbid the use of Generative AI in this course. In fact, the nature of the course compels us to explore it, and we will in fact cover generative AI tools this semester. Thus in lieu of a more formal or specific policy, we will follow a similar policy for generative AI as we use for open source code. You will need to clearly spell out what tool(s) you use, what your prompts were (if applicable), link to any GitHub repositories, CoLab Notebooks or any generative AI software tools you used. Again, we will cover some of these so generative AI is part of the course content anyway. However, as with the use of someone else's code, simply taking something and tweaking it slightly will be considered a form of plagiarism, or at least laziness. As with code and computation more generally, you will be asked to be creative and inventive with the use of generative AI.
