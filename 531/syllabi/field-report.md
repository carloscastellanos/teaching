# What is a "Field Report"?

For this course, you will periodically be asked to “survey the field”. That is, browse various blogs, web sites, academic journals or other resources in order to deepen your knowledge of the field and familiarize yourself with the current state of the art. You will then be expected to report on your findings — hopefully with a critical perspective. Some weeks, the "Field Report" deliverables may be thematically oriented. There is no restriction on the sources of information you may use.

A "Field Report" is a brief post that reports on a new media project that interests you. Your job is to browse blogs and other sources, and then report on an artwork or other project *that you haven’t seen before*. Blogging about a project of which you’re already aware defeats the point of the assignment, which is to deepen your familiarity with the fields of new media arts and creative technology — *and develop your own personal research practice*.

Try to find things that you aspire to make yourself. If you're not finding projects that interest you, ask your professor for advice. You probably just need to find the right search terms. For this course, it may be most appropriate to select projects that are made by individuals or small teams, rather than large companies, but that's not a strong requirement.


### How to do a Field Report

In a posting (on your blog),

* **write** a paragraph (~150 words) about the project that interested you and **embed** relevant images and/or video documentation of the project.

In the paragraph you write, you should:

* **Explain** the project in a sentence or two (what it is, how it operates, etc.);
* Explain what **inspires** you about the project (i.e. what you find interesting or admirable);
* **Critique** the project: describe how it might have been more effective; discuss some of the intriguing possibilities that it suggests, or opportunities that it missed; explain what you think the creator(s) got right, and how they got it right.
* **Research** the project's chain of influences. Dig up the "deep background" and compare the project with related work or prior art, if appropriate. What sources inspired the creator this project? What might _their_ field report look like?
Please be sure to label your blog post with a "category". Part of the purpose of your documentation is to increase the documentation, in the world, of noteworthy but vulnerable media artifacts. Therefore, when including video documentation of projects:

### Evaluation of your Looking Outwards Reports
Each report can receive one of two marks:

* **0 points.** You did not do the report.
* **1 point.** You did the report.

### Learning Outcomes of Field Reports

After completing the sequence of Field Reports, you will be able to:

* Demonstrate familiarity with historic and/or contemporary new media projects relevant to _your_ specific research interests
* Demonstrate familiarity with new media projects that exemplify cultural practices that feature widely-used arts-engineering/art-science toolkits, methods or specific technologies.

### Where to research your Field Report subjects

You are strongly encouraged to visit the university library (as in go in -person). It has books, films and other media that are not online. You may still of ocourse, conduct your research online as well. And in fact the library has access to online resources (jounrals, books, films, etc) that are not avilable or easy to find witha somle Google search. In addition, below is a list of some prominent online feeds that present current work in new media art. This list is intended as a starting point for preparing your reports. Highly recommended:

* [CreativeApplications.net](http://www.creativeapplications.net/)
* [We Make Money Not Art](https://we-make-money-not-art.com/)
* [Eyeo Festival Videos](https://vimeo.com/eyeofestival/videos/all)
* [Media Art Tube](http://www.youtube.com/user/MediaArtTube)

### Warning

In a group of approximately a dozen students, the likelihood that two people would choose to write a Field Report about the same project ought to be infinitesimally small, given the *thousands* (likely tens or hundreds of thousands) of interesting projects that exist. Yet it happens. How is this possible? It seems some students are satisfied to select something from the first page of results returned from a search. That is not especially deep research. To encourage students to dig deepeer, at the professor's discretion, two students who both submit reports about the same project may each receive no credit.
