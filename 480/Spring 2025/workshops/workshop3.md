# Workshop 3: Designing Interactive Cultural Experiences Using AR & Locative Media

## Objective

By the end of this workshop, students will:

- Understand the basic principles of interactive experiences using AR and locative media.
- Explore tools and techniques for designing engaging, site-specific AR experiences.
- Create a small prototype AR experience of your :zap:***final project***:zap: that tells a story or highlights cultural significance in a specific location in Rochester.

## Materials/Resources Needed

- Smartphones or tablets (iOS or Android).
- Laptop or Desktop computer with a code editor (e.g. VS Code)
- Access to a web server to host files (i.e. Glitch.com, GitHub Pages or your RIT student account)
- Digital mapping tools (e.g., Google Maps) or printed maps (if that's how you roll))
- Depending on your project you may also need:
    - software for creating assets (e.g. 3D models, sound files, etc) 
    - printed fiducial markers, logos or other images

## Workshop Outline

1. Interactive Cultural Experiences Using AR & Locative Media
- Organize into your final project groups
- As a group, review examples of AR and locative media we've discussed in class (e.g., _Lapse_, _Portal to an Alternative Reality_, _Night Walk for Edinburgh_), and others if you like.
- Select some questions for discussion (see lecture slides, or come up with your own).

2. Conceptualizing Your Project
- Brainstorming:
    - **Drawing from your fieldwork notes and documentaton (photos, sound recordings,etc), lectures slides and other resources:**
        - Identify/discuss a cultural story, landmark, or event from Rochester that you encountered in your fieldwork that you want to highlight.
        - Define the target audience and desired interaction (e.g., education, exploration, entertainment).
        - Define the overall experience (discovering a lost history, inspiring community action, critical lens...).
- Storyboard:
    - Sketch out the user journey: What do participants see, hear, and do?
    - Define key points of interaction or storytelling.

3. Prototyping the Experience
- Tools and Assets
    - Use AR.js & A-Frame or explore another tool if you feel comfortable with it (e.g. Unity with AR Foundation)
    - Determine assets you will need (3D models, video, etc)
- Group Work:
    - Create a basic AR scene based on your storyboard (create the assets and code it).
    - Incorporate at least one interactive or locative element.
    - Test the experience on mobile devices.
- Feedback Session:
    - Share prototypes with peers for feedback.
    - Identify strengths and areas for improvement.

4. Discussion and Reflection
- Group Discussion:
    - What challenges did you face in designing/developing your AR experience?
    - How did the locative elements contribute to the storytelling?
- Future Applications:
    - How could you expand or adapt your project?

## Assignment Submission

- Document this whole process: code and the steps, questions, discussion, etc.
- Submit all your work on myCourses (details available there).
