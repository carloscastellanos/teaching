# Fieldwork Guide: Conceptualizing Site-Specific Works Using Augmented Reality

## Overview
This fieldwork guide will help us explore and analyze real-world locations to develop site-specific AR/Locative Media projects. It focuses on observing spatial, cultural, and historical elements of the site and brainstorming creative ways to integrate AR into the chosen environment. You will draw from your fieldwork over the next couple of weeks and when you begin to brainstorm your final group projects.

## Objectives
- Develop an understanding of site-specificity in the context of AR and locative media.
- Analyze the spatial, cultural, and social aspects of a location.
- Generate initial concepts for AR experiences tailored to the site.
