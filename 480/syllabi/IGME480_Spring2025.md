# Course Description

## Catalog Description

Interactive media development is a rapidly evolving field. This course provides an opportunity for students to learn and experiment with emerging themes, practices, and technologies that are not addressed elsewhere in the curriculum. Topics covered in this course will vary based on current developments in the field. Students will explore, design, and develop creative interactive experiences pertaining to the semester's domain area. Programming projects are required.

## Detailed Description

This semester's domain area for IGME 480 is **_Augmented Reality and Locative Media for Arts & Culture_**. We will explore the intersection of augmented reality (AR) and locative media, and their applications in arts and culture. Students will work as members of _Rochester City Arts Lab_. _RCAL_ is a participatory arts and technology initiative to collaboratively share hidden histories of the city of Rochester by combining media arts, mobile augmented reality (AR) and locative media. The vision is to create public digital artworks and experiences featuring three of Rochester's most historic city neighborhoods: Canal St (in the Susan B. Anthony neighborhood), the Vacuum Oil brownfield site (in the Plymouth Exchange neighborhood), and East Ave (in Downtown/East End). Students’ creations will be virtually installed, geo-located, visually and sonically superimposed on the real world through mobile devices. Students will practice a unique blend of technology, art, and community engagement grounded in site work, walks, research, art and experimentation. Within this context, students will learn the theoretical foundations of AR and locative media, examine case studies, and develop creative projects that integrate these technologies into artistic and cultural contexts. By the end of the course, students will have practical experience in designing and implementing AR and locative media projects.

# Course Overview

## Topics

This course covers the practical application of AR and locative media development to the creation of explorative and/or expressive media. Topics to be covered include:

- mobile augmented/mixed reality development
- locative media, GPS (global positioning system) and "speculative mapping"
- AR public sculptures, installations and sound works
- creative placemaking
- history of the city of Rochester
- sensors and physical computing

## Course Goals & Learning Objectives

Invention and creative experimentation are the overarching goals and ethos of this course. In addition, at the course's conclusion, students will be able to:

- Understand the historical and theoretical underpinnings of augmented reality and locative media
- Analyze and critique contemporary uses of AR and locative media in arts and culture
- Identify and discuss the work of artists, researchers and other creative practitioners working in AR and locative media
- Develop skills in AR content creation tools and locative media platforms
- Design and implement a creative AR/locative media project.
- Understand how to document, discuss and present creative work

## Course Format

**Lectures:** Weekly discussions on foundational concepts and case studies.

**Workshops:** Hands-on sessions for learning AR and locative media tools.

**Fieldwork:** Exploration of local spaces for implementing locative projects.

**Presentations:** Student presentations of their work

**Final Public Project:** Final group projects integrating AR and locative media. :zap: **_These projects will be shared with the public_** :zap:. Students will present their work to the community and exhibit their projects in conjunction with a local arts and culture organization. The projects will be live and running by the end of the semester.

## Required Texts

There are no required text purchases for this course. There are however learning resources (books, articles, web sites, etc) available through myCourses. You will also be required to open an account at [GitHub.com](https://github.com).

## Required Materials

- Computer: Students should have access to a desktop or laptop computer with a webcam. A reliable internet connection will also be very important.
- Mobile phone or tablet: Students should have access to a mobile phone or tablet with a camera, GPS and internet connectivity
- Sketchbook: It is wise to plan your projects on paper before writing any code. In support of this, you are required to maintain a paper sketchbook for this course. Most assignments will require you to post images of your project sketches.
- Programming Environments: the programming language used for sample code and workshops will be JavaScript. For the purposes of simplicity, accesibility and easy cross-plattform compabitibility we will use [AR.js](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/) and [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)
- Camera: Students should have access to a digital camera to document certain projects. A smartphone with a camera is acceptable.
- Other materials/resources needed for specific assignments will be mentioned as needed

## Learning Resources

Available resources include books, articles, videos, web sites and GitHub repositories. We will also make use of threaded online discussions. All of this is available through (you guessed it) myCourses.

## Assessment Structure

There are approximately 6 main assignments (1 minor project, 3 workshops, midterm presentation and final project) on which students will receive critical feedback from the instructor and their peers. Critical feedback on the content or quality of projects will not factor into grades, :zap: **_except where such feedback concerns missing or incomplete components of the assignment or where the overall effort is determined by the instructor to be lacking._** :zap: In other words, if you do the work digently and assiduously, and don't just "phone it in", you shouldn't have to worry about your grades.

# Philosophy

This course operates under the following principles:

**Experiential Learning.** We learn by doing. The course emphasizes immediate application of theory into practical demonstrations. Success — and especially failures — of an experiment helps create understanding of underlying principles.

**Collaboration & Cooperative Learning.** We teach each other. Knowledge sharing and creative dialogue are critical to success in this course and in creative work in general. Success in this field requires an ability to collaborate within diverse cohorts of technology, arts and design experts. Collaborative skill requires excellence in one’s own areas of expertise and an ability to translate ideas across disciplinary boundaries.

**Self-motivation.** Students are responsible for their own progress. Wherever possible, the driving motivation will be a self-chosen goal, divided into manageable subproblems. The desire for the goal prompts autonomous exploration. If you ever find the course dull, that is an opportunity to reflect on what you are trying to achieve and choose a new objective.

**Critical Thinking, Reflection and Writing.** Understanding develops through reflection, and the best discipline for reflection is writing and drawing. Mere repetition of the examples does not build skill; it is the process of reflection which integrates experience into knowledge which can be applied to novel situations.

# Attendance

## Attendance & Presence

_"80% of success is showing up"_— Woody Allen

Your presence and earnest participation in the class are of paramount importance. You are responsible for what happens in class whether you are here or not. Organize with your classmates to get class information and material that you have missed.

Additionally, communication is paramount when it comes to your attendance. If you are going to be absent or tardy, please contact the professor in a timely manner regarding your situation. Email is best, but I am also amenable to receiving messages via Twitter DM, or the RIT Slack. If you are ill, or if you know you will have a planned absence, please let me know before the beginning of that class session. I can be very understanding and accommodating about planned and necessary absences, family circumstances, and/or medical issues when you inform me in a timely and professional manner.

Regarding your mental presence in the classroom: physical presence means nothing if you are "checked out". Focus is precious, and your mental presence is extremely important. During the professor's lectures or (especially) during guest presentations, distracted "participation" is simply put — bad form, and will not be tolerated. You can survive for a couple of hours without texting, tweeting, chatting, emailing, or doing work for other courses.

## A Word About Unexcused Absences in Critiques

Sometimes, students who haven’t completed their projects skip class during critiques, because they are too embarrassed to come to class empty-handed. This type of absence is particularly self-destructive, and is one of the most objectionable things you can do in this class. Please have courage. Your participation on critique days is essential, even if your own project is incomplete or missing, because these sessions and conversations help you understand our class standards, expectations, and criteria for good work. :zap: **_Even if your own project is unfinished, you are still expected to contribute productively to the class discussion_** :zap: .

## Attendance Policy Summary

**Terms:**

* A **class event** is an in-class activity, such as a lecture or critique, in which your presence and participation is expected.
* An **excused absence** is one in which you've communicated responsibly with the professor prior to class. For example, if you've sent an email to the professor because you're not feeling well, or if you know in advance that you're going to be observing a religious holiday or traveling to a job interview. Contacting the professor beforehand can make it possible to provide you with accommodations—such as recording a class event, or providing a Zoom connection for a remote participant.
* An **unexcused absence** is one in which you've _ghosted_ a class event, without communicating beforehand with the professor.
* A **mental absence** is a form of partial absence in which you might as well be elsewhere. For example, while walking around the room, I plainly observe that you're working on homework for another course. Sleeping in class is also a form of mental absence.
* **Tardiness** is a form of partial absence in which you are more than 20 minutes late to a class event. Tardiness may be excused or unexcused.

**Policies:**

* Students should contact the professor before class to alert him to their absence.
* Grades may factor in a count of unexcused absences, but not excused absences.
* You are permitted one unexcused absence.
* A post-hoc excuse for an unexcused absence may or may not be accepted, at the professor's discretion.
* The first incidence of unexcused tardiness will be noted, but excused.
* The first incidence of mental absence will be noted, but excused.

**Advisory:**

The three least forgivable violations of our course attendance policy are:

1. Sleeping during a presentation by an outside guest
2. Unexcused absence during a critique
3. Unexcused absence... and then I bump into you in the hallway chatting with your friends later that day

# Assignments

## Overview

Assignments are not simply about writing code. Every assignment will have associated readings, research and reflective writing components (discussed below). Some will require fieldwork. In addition, your instructor will provide important historical context, show examples and provide other notes and resources relevant to the assignment topic/theme. Tentatively, there are 6-8 assignments:

- one minor project
- approximately 3-5 workshop assignments (some graded, some not)
- midterm project proposal & presentation
- final project and public presentation

## Journal & Documentation

Every assignment requires that you document your process. :zap: **_You will be expected to keep an online journal/blog_** :zap: of your work in this class. Project updates, fieldwork, research process, readings, interesting links – all of these go in your journal. This is essentially part of your attendance/participation grade. In addition, specific requirements will be provided for each assignment. Part of these requirements will entail the submission of a ["Field Report"](https://github.com/carloscastellanos/teaching/blob/master/480/syllabi/field-report.md). You will periodically be asked to "survey the field". That is, browse various blogs, web sites, academic journals or other resources in order to deepen your knowledge of the field and familiarize yourself with the current state of the art. You will then be expected to report on your findings — hopefully with a critical perspective. Some weeks, the "Field Report" deliverables may be thematically oriented. There is no restriction on the sources of information you may use.

The journal is a reflection of yourself as a professional and should demonstrate that. Therefore, even if you do have a website/blog already, :zap: **_this course requires that you create a website/blog unique to this course_** :zap: . This will be a website that you will continue to use throughout this course and perhaps your duration in the program. For this semester I am asking everyone to create an account on the free blogging platform [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/free).

In addition to the journal, you will also upload your programming assignments (with some possible exceptions) to GitHub. This will make it easier for all of us to see your programming assignments. You will simply need to post a link to the GutHub repository in your assignment submission.

**Good documentation habits:**

Document your projects thoroughly as you go, do not put it off until the end. Plan in advance to have what you need to document. Photos, video, sketches, schematics, code and notes are all possible forms of documentation. More specific instructions will be given for each assignment but in general you will need to include general description (what it is, does), the goal(s) of the project, add the ideas/inspirations and results/experience (i.e. a narrative reflection). Your explanation should give enough information that someone who’s never seen the project can understand it. In addition (as mentioned below), you will also write a reflection on the readings and your overall research process.

Make sure the code is well-commented, so you and others can understand what it does.

Make sure to cite sources from which you get your ideas, code, and construction techniques. When you base your work on someone else’s, cite the original author and link to their work, just as you would when quoting another author in a paper. Very few ideas come out of nowhere, and your readers can learn a lot from the sources from which you learned and by which you were inspired. This is how knowledge and innovation work. So please be generous in sharing your sources.

## Readings & Response

Readings, videos, and other supplementary materials will be included as part of every assignment. These might include excerpts from academic texts, academic papers, recorded conference talks, blog posts, or any other relevant material. :zap: **_You will be expected to write a short 1-page response for each in your journal._** :zap: Remember that this is essentially a curated collection of material. You could do your own research (and will, especially for your final project), but I am helping you by sharing what I think is most important. Part of learning is knowing where to look and conducting your own research. This is why it is important to do the readings, and come to class with thoughts and questions for discussion. It helps you gain confidence in these "meta-skills" of researching, questioning, generating ideas, etc. As always, if you're struggling to keep up with the readings, do not hesitate to ask for help.

# Grading

Your work will be evaluated according to three different schemes, which are decoupled to the greatest extent possible:

- **Grades**: standards used by RIT on its transcripts to indicate your objective level of effort in a course; see Class Grade Components below
- **Rubrics**: standards used by our class community in critiques to provide subjective feedback about your creative projects
- **Professionalism**: standards used by the professor to judge your professional conduct, which help me decide whether I might someday write a letter of recommendation for you, agree to offer independent study credits to you, hire you as a research assistant, etc.

## Rubrics for Creative Projects

The purpose of our open-ended projects is to provide well-circumscribed opportunities for you to make creative work with AR, code and technology more broadly. Generally, the prompts will invite you to explore a specific conceptual theme or set of programming techniques. As such - and since there is no "correct" or "best" or "optimal" artwork or cultural artifact - there is no correct solution to these assignments and no specific requirement for how to implement your idea (unless otherwise specified). A prompt also asks not just for a creative solution, but also for some :zap: **_creativity in defining and approaching the problem_**. :zap: It is expected that your projects will be documented and published to your online journal.

With creative projects, it may not matter how much time a student spent making it. You may sometimes observe a very quickly-executed solution which succeeds because of its strong concept. Usually, however, the quality of a project is rewarded by extra attention to its craft.

In our critiques, we will evaluate your open-ended projects according to the following subjective considerations:

- **Curiosity:** Are you asking questions as you work?
- **Perseverance:** Are you forging through difficult problems without giving up?
- **Execution:** Are you crafting with purpose, precision, and attention?
- **Inventiveness and Risk-Taking:** Are you discovering/exploring methods outside the obvious and predictable? Are you taking risks and pushing past what you already know and discovering new territories, terms, skills, connections, etc. Ideas that fail often teach more than ideas that succeed.

## Grade Calculation

In this course, your grades boil down to fulfillment. Assignments always have a list of supporting requirements. These are very straightforward to fulfill, but if you fail to meet these, you will have points deducted. Nearly every project assignment will ask you to do the following:

- Create a unique blog post for your project.
- Title and Categorize your blog post in a specified manner.
- Embed a photo of your notebook sketches for the project, if applicable.
- Embed a static image of your project, such as a screenshot or photograph.
- Embed dynamic documentation of your project (such as an animated GIF, video recording, or interactive applet) into the blog post, if applicable.
- Read an article(s) or watch a video and write a short (~1-page) response.
- Write 100-200 words about your project, describing its development process. In your writing, include some critical reflection and analysis of your project: In what ways did you succeed, and in what ways could it be better?
- Embed or link to your code, if requested.
- As per our course policies on Academic Integrity, you must also:
  - Name any other students from whom you received advice or help. If you had collaborators, explain how the work was distributed among the collaborators.
  - Cite and link to the sources for any code, external libraries, or other media (e.g. photographs, soundtracks, source images) which you used in your Project. **_Citing your sources is very important_**. If in doubt, err on the side of generosity.

## Grade Components

Grading procedure for the course follows [University Policy D05.0](https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/d050), which describes policies regarding points awarded for grade, handling of withdrawals (D05.0, Section IV), and so on.

## Professionalism

There are a few elementary things you can do to ensure that you retain my highest respect for your professionalism. These things may seem simple and obvious, but it's sometimes surprising how few students seem to get this right. At a minimum, I ask you to:

- **Be nice.** Maintain a positive, friendly attitude.
- **Be present.** Show up to all course sessions, on time.
- **Be responsible.** Communicate with the professor beforehand if you must miss a session or if there are any problems, questions, or circumstances that hinder your full participation in the course.
- **Be diligent.** Submit your deliverables, on time, with clear and thorough documentation.

Beyond this, I would love it if you could:

- **Be helpful.** Help your classmates when they’re stuck.
- **Be fearless.** Take risks. Work outside your comfort zone. :zap: **Give yourself permission to be weird.** :zap:
- **Be conscientious.** Pay attention to details of craft and execution. Put your heart in the work.
- **Be persevering.** Become resourceful about getting the assistance you need.
- **Be generous.** Participate in the life of the course. Make helpful contributions to lectures, discussions and critiques.

## Late Policy

Assignments are due at the announced date and time (usually the due date posted with the assignment on myCourses). When you submit work late, you will miss an important opportunity to share, show off, discuss and get critical feedback on your work. To receive this important feedback, your work must be available for evaluation during the critical review period. Thus, to receive :zap: ***full credit*** :zap: towards your grade, assignments should be uploaded and completed by the time that I get around to checking them and/or by the time we have class discussion and critiques on them (which is usually on the stated due date or a few days after). If not, I reserve the right to assign partial or zero credit to them. If you know you're going to be a little late with a project, contact me to arrange an accommodation.

## Follow Your Passion

I will assume that most of you are here (that is, in this class and/or at IGM) because you are passionate about media arts, games or otherwise combining technology and creativity. As the course progresses you will likely notice that I will not show much actual code in lectures and workshops. Although there will be examples of "starter code" and other sources of code available, the main reason for the limited amount of code examples is because it has been shown to dramatically narrows students’ imaginations, and thus the scope and impact of resulting projects. With very rare exceptions (I'll be clear), I will almost always prefer that you :zap: **_make the assignment interesting to you_** :zap: — if necessary, by creatively bending the rules or re-interpreting the assignment. Having too many ready-made, cookie-cutter "solutions" for programming problems may hinder this process. The assignments are starting-points, prompts and propositions. They are inteded to make space for diverse and personalized work, to preserve student curiosity, whimsy, and critical reflection. Think beyond them.

Notwithstanding the above, you will always be expected to conform to certain supporting requirements (described above) in regard to deliverables and documentation. Did you include an image of your project? Did you write the requested narrative? Such requirements are non-negotiable.

# Academic Integrity

The RIT policy on academic integrity is available at: [https://www.rit.edu/policies/d080](https://www.rit.edu/policies/d080). Please read them to understand the penalties associated with academic dishonesty. I reserve the right to determine an appropriate penalty based on the violation of academic dishonesty that occurs. The penalty for plagiarizing may range from failure on the specific plagiarized assignment to failure in the class. If you have any questions about this policy as it relates to work you are doing in the course, please feel free to contact the professor.

## Policies for Open-Ended Creative Projects

For your open-ended, public-facing projects, which will be presented and hosted online on myCourses, GitHub or elsewhere, there are no “correct answers”. Your curiosity, creativity, ingenuity and originality are what's important.

You may borrow code or ideas from other sources, within the limits of "reasonable person" principles described below, provided you **_attribute your sources_**. Your work will appear, publicly, on the open Internet. Your projects will likely be discussed and critiqued in front of (and with the assistance of) your peers.

You are expected or invited to make extensive use of open-source libraries and tutorials. When working in this way, much like a knitting circle, our classroom is structured around peer instruction, in which students are expected to help each other learn.

## Use of Free and Open-Source Code in Projects

You are expected or invited to make extensive use of open-source libraries and tutorials. When working in this way, much like a knitting circle, our classroom is structured around peer instruction, in which students are expected to help each other learn.

Credit is perhaps the most important form of currency in the economies of commons-based peer production and open-source media arts. You are expected to cite the source of any code you use. Please note the following expectations and guidelines:

**Use Libraries.** In your projects, the use of general, reusable libraries is strongly encouraged. The people who developed and contributed these components to the community worked hard, often for no pay; acknowledge them by citing their name and linking to their repository.

**Be Careful.** It sometimes happens that an artist or developer places the entire source code for their artwork online, as a resource from which others can learn. The assignments professors give in new-media arts courses are often similar; you may discover the work of a student in some other class or school, who has posted code for a project which responds to a similar assignment. You should probably avoid this code. At the very least, you should be very, very careful about approaching such code for possible re-use. If it is necessary to do so, it is best to extract components that solve a specific technical problem, rather than those parts which operate to create a unique creative experience. Your challenge, if and/or when you work with others’ code, is to :zap: **_make it your own_** :zap: . It should be clear that forking an artwork from someone’s page on GitHub, OpenProcessing, etc., and simply changing the colors would be disgracefully lazy. Doing so without proper citation would be plagiarism.

## Informal Collaboration

This course places a very high value on civic responsibility that includes, but is not limited to, helping others learn. In this course, we strongly encourage you to give help (or ask others for help) in using various toolkits, algorithms, libraries, or other facilities. Please note the following expectations:

- In this class, **_it’s OK to give and receive help._** In fact, it’s better than OK! But students who receive help from someone else are obliged to acknowledge that person in their project report, clarifying the nature of the help that was received.
- **_We are all teachers._** Students with advanced skills are expected to help others, yet refrain from doing another’s work for them. You can usually tell when you’re about to cross the line: Ask yourself whether you are teaching someone to fish, or merely giving them the fish.
- When in doubt: **_give credit_** to the people who have helped you.

## Formal Collaboration

Much of the work in this course will be in formal groups. Hopefully these groups and collaborations will arise organically but the instructor may add, remove or reasign someone to specifics groups if deemed necessary. In addition, please note the following basic requirements and expectations for group work:

- **Notify the Professor.** The professor needs to know who is working with whom. Formal groups will jointly inform the professor as part of their assignments.
- **Describe who did what.** Written reports for collaborative projects should describe how your effort was distributed.
- **Only IGME480 collaborators.** Unless approved by your instructor, your project collaborators must be enrolled in this class. You may not collaborate with people from outside the course (e.g. your housemate).

# Additional Information

## Communication

I will be using email and myCourses announcements to communicate reminders, updates to assignments, etc. Please check these regularly to make sure you have the most up to date information. You are welcome to communicate anything to me regarding the course via email. I will almost always respond to emails within 24 hours. We will also use myCourses discussions for questions, link-sharing and general class discussion.

**If you need to discuss grades or personal matters, I ask that you do it via my RIT email address**.


## Statement on Well-Being & Success

Success in this course depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Recognize that stress is an expected part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the classroom. Moreover, those with marginalized identities may be faced with additional social stressors. Your other instructors and I strongly encourage you to reframe challenges as an unavoidable pathway to success. Reflect on your role in taking care of yourself throughout the term, before the demands of exams and projects reach their peak. Please feel free to reach out to me about any difficulty you may be having that may impact your performance in this course as soon as it occurs and before it becomes unmanageable. In addition to your academic advisor, I strongly encourage you to contact the many other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you.

## Statement on the Use of Generative AI

I will not forbid the use of Generative AI in this course. In fact, the nature of the course may compel us to explore it. Thus in lieu of a more formal or specific policy, we will follow a similar policy for generative AI as we use for open source code. You will need to clearly spell out what tool(s) you use, what your prompts were (if applicable), link to any GitHub repositories, Google CoLab Notebooks or any generative AI software tools you used. As with the use of someone else's code, simply taking something and tweaking it slightly will be considered a form of plagiarism, or at least laziness. As with code and computation more generally, you will be asked to be creative and inventive with the use of generative AI. AI can't do that for you.
